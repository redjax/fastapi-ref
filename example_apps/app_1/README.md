# App 1

A simple FastAPI app demonstrating some core functionality/syntax. Makes use of Python's `Annotated`, FastAPI's `status` and `HTTPException` classes, `CORSMiddleware`, `Depends` dependency injection, and Pydantic schemas.

No database or `APIRouter`, just a simple API with a few endpoints.

**Best for**: A quick prototype that doesn't need a database, security, or many endpoints.
